# RecursiveLinkedListLength
A small script for recursively finding the length of a linked list in C++

Script takes in an int as a command line argument and populates internal linked list to given size, then recursively calls
listLength() to recursively determine list size. This script is mostly useless and was made to practice building recursive functions
